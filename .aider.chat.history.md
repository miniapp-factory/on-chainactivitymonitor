I need to edit the app metadata and create a logo image description.  
Please add the current contents of **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** to the chat so I can propose the exact changes.  
I will also create a new file **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** for the logo.

A stylized logo featuring a stylized blockchain network of interconnected nodes forming a subtle hexagonal pattern, with a magnifying glass overlaying the center to represent real‑time monitoring. The background is a gradient from deep navy blue at the top to a lighter teal at the bottom, giving a sense of depth and technology. The magnifying glass is silver with a subtle glow, and the network nodes are bright cyan, highlighting connectivity. The overall composition conveys vigilance, data analysis, and the dynamic nature of blockchain activity, suitable for a crypto‑focused monitoring app.
